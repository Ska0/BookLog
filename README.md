# BookLog


I had alot of fun on this project

Key things that I learned from this project 

   1. how to add an Event Listener to elements that will be created through the DOM
   2. how to create a modal and use a button to open it
   3. how to use prototype functions to modify the properties of an object
   4. how to use the array.splice() method to remove an object from the array 

   1/5/22 - Refactored the Javascript Object Constructor 'Book' to a Class 'Book'
          - Updated CSS to change the background colors of the elements for better display
